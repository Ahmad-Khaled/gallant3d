Currently, we only provide PLA (Polylactic Acid) filament. We offer PLA in the following colors: Black, Grey, White, Transparent, and Orange.

### 3. What file formats does Gallant accept for 3D printing?

We accept any 3D model file types, but we start printing with the STL (Standard Tessellation Language) format.

Customers can simply send us the STL file of their design. They can email it to us or use any other convenient file transfer method. Once the file is submitted, they can expect their print to be ready for pickup in one or two business days.

### 5. What is the typical turnaround time for a 3D printing project?

The turnaround time depends on the complexity and size of the print. For prints weighing less than 50 grams, we guarantee same-day delivery. Larger prints may require additional time, typically within one to two business days.

At Gallant, protecting your privacy is our top priority. To ensure the security of your designs, we recommend sharing only the STL file, as it cannot be easily edited or manipulated.

Currently, we do not provide support or consultation for 3D design assistance. However, we are actively working on adding this service in the near future.
